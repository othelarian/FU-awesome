Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search previous suggestions before adding a new one
* Projects should be reasonably complete: Tools should be in a usable and useful state. Modules should be playable
* Projects should be specific to the FU system, the Action Tales system, or a related project
* Make individual pull requests for each suggestion
* Pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the project
* Use the following format in README.md : `[resource name](link) - Description`
* If project does not have a unique name, use the format "[name] by [author]" to distinguish it from other projects
* Descriptions should be short and meaningful
* Maintain consistent description formatting, descriptions begin with a capital letter, are a single sentence long, and should not contain a trailing full stop (.)
* If no dedicated URL is available for the project, add it to the "Projects without URLs list", under an appropriate parent section (that does have a link)
* Projects in a section should be alphabetized by project name
* New categories, and improvements to existing categorization are welcome

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, here is a guide on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
